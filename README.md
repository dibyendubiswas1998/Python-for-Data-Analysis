# Python for Data Analysis:
This is include the details about Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pyplot, Plotly, GGPlot. <br>



## All Visualizations:
#### Line Plot:
* Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time. 
* When smaller changes exist, line graphs are better to use than bar graphs. 
* Line graphs can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.
* Line graph also use to track the changes over the some categories, etc.


#### Scatter Plot:
* A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. 
* Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.
* Scatter plots are used to observe correlation between two random variables.


#### Distribution Plot (displot):
* The distribution plot is suitable for comparing range and distribution for groups of numerical data. 
* It is used basically for univariant set of observations and visualizes it through a histogram i.e. only one observation and hence we choose one particular column of the dataset.


#### KDE Plot (kdeplot):
* kdeplot() function is used to plot the data against a single/univariate variable. 
* It represents the probability distribution of the data values as the area under the plotted curve.
* It shows the distribution of your data smoothly


#### Hitogram Plot (histplot):
* The histogram is a popular graphing tool. 
* It is used to summarize discrete or continuous data that are measured on an interval scale. 
* It is often used to illustrate the major features of the distribution of the data in a convenient form.
* You can mention the bins size, mean group the data


#### Categorical Plot:
* Plots are basically used for visualizing the relationship between variables. 
* Those variables can be either be completely numerical or a category like a group, class or division.
* Show the comparison between categorical data & numerical data (in categorical feature, it possible there are multiple categories are present).


#### Strip Plot (stripplot):
* A strip plot is a single-axis scatter plot that is used to visualise the distribution of many individual one-dimensional values. 
* The values are plotted as dots along one unique axis, and the **dots with the same value can overlap.**


#### Swarm Plot (swarmplot):
* Same as strip plot, but the data points are not overlap.


#### Box Plot (boxplot):
* Box plots are used to show distributions of numeric data values, especially when you want to compare them between multiple groups. 
* They are built to provide high-level information at a glance, **offering general information about a group of data's symmetry, skew, variance, and outliers.**


#### Bar Plot (barplot):
* Bar charts should be used when you are showing segments of information. 
* Vertical bar charts are useful to compare different categorical or discrete variables, such as age groups, classes, schools, etc., as long as there are not too many categories to compare.
* Bar graphs are used to compare things between different groups or to track changes over time.


#### Count Plot (countplot):
* countplot() method is used to Show the counts of observations in each categorical bin using bars.
* The countplot is used to represent the occurrence(counts) of the observation present in the categorical variable.


#### Heat Map (heatmap):
* Heatmaps are used to show relationships between two variables, one plotted on each axis. By observing how cell colors change across each axis, you can observe if there are any patterns in value for one or both variables.
* Heat Map is used for showing the correlation between the variables,
* Heat Map is used to show the missing points of your dataset.


#### Pie Chart:
* Pie charts are often used to represent sample data—with data points belonging to a combination of different categories. Each of these categories is represented as a “slice of the pie.” The size of each slice is directly proportional to the number of data points that belong to a particular category.
* It helps to the distribution over a categories.
